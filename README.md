# ICU Stay Prediction

A supervised ML task that aims at predicting the stay in intensive care unit of a cardiac hospital using the labs, procedures, ICU stay, hospital stay and mortality status.

## Project Info

A cardiac patient who was operated a surgical procedure will stay in the intensive care unit for some days depending on his overall health performance and recovery untill discharge from hospital to home unless a sudden death doesn't happen. The project data includes:

- Surgical procedure(s) (True/False)
- Labs results (Troponin/CK/CK(MB)/WBCs/CRP)
- Days spent in ICU
- Days spent in hospital
- Mortality status (Yes/No)

## Recuirements

The projects requires you to be aware of the ML lifecycle including experience in Python, data analysis, visualization, data preprocessing and common ML algorithms.

## Project Specs

- Python 3.8
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Virtual Environment
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Pytest (unit testing)

## End Goal

ML model that is able to predict ICU stay of a cardiac patient in hospital.

**Note: The task might be expanded to use AWS services to deploy, monitor and get real-life predictions**
